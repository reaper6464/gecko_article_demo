"Subject: RE: PRD NxtPad

Salut Guillaume,

Je fouille présentement dans mes vieux mails.

J’aimerais avoir un peu plus d’information quant à ce point.

Est-ce qu’on a une bonne définition de ce qu’on veut dire par ‘’eau trop chaude’’ ?

J’imagine qu’on parle d’une situation où le pack (au travers de son senseur) évalue que la température de l’eau est aller au-delà de 40 °C ?

Si tel est le cas, j’implémenterais effectivement une rétroaction software où l’écran du keypad flash avec un symbol danger.

Les lumières peuvent également flasher si jamais cette option est installée.

Ce sera un requis que je devrais rajouter pour l’aspect software du projet.","Title: Hot Water Alert System Implementation

Category: Upcoming Feature

Product: in.k1000

To enhance safety and user experience, a new feature is being developed for Gecko spa systems that will address situations where water temperatures exceed a safe threshold. Specifically, if the water temperature is detected to be over 40 °C (104 °F), an alert system will be activated. This system involves a visual cue on the in.k1000 keypad, where the display will flash a danger symbol, warning users about the excessively hot water.

In addition to the keypad alert, there will be an option to have the spa lights flash, provided that this feature is installed in the setup. This will offer an additional layer of notification, ensuring that users are promptly alerted to the hazardous condition. As part of the ongoing project developments, this software requirement will be incorporated to enhance user safety and provide clear, immediate communication of critical water temperature conditions."

Déclaration de","Title: Enhancing Cable Flexibility for Gecko Devices

Category: Knowledge

Product: in.k1000

To optimize installation and operation of spa systems, there is a targeted requirement that the cable connecting the keypad to the Gecko ""Cortex"" must support up to 16 feet of distance. This ensures flexibility for different spa configurations, particularly for larger swim spas which can require extended distances.

The current specification highlights a limitation of the USB protocol in retaining signal integrity over greater distances. USB cables typically experience signal degradation beyond a certain length, generally around 16 feet. This presents challenges for Do-It-Yourself (DIY) installations or custom spa builds where the control distances exceed this measure.

Consideration is being given to introducing a signal extender into the product roadmap. This development would allow for greater flexibility and distance without compromising the signal integrity crucial for seamless spa operation. Anticipating customer needs for greater lengths, implementing a signal extender could bridge the gap effectively and maintain the reliability expected from Gecko products.

Implementers and end-users should remain aware of cable limitations and stay tuned for future enhancements which are in deliberation, indicating proactive solution development for extending system functionality."

Déclaration de","Title: Implementation of Failsafe Mode in Power Management

Category: Knowledge

Product: in.ye, in.xe

The implementation of a failsafe mode in the power management product is essential to ensure safe operation under critical conditions. This feature activates when a critical variable, such as water temperature reaching unsafe levels or the Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) circuit being open (tripped), is detected. The purpose of the failsafe mode is to prevent any potential damage to the spa unit by immediately taking corrective actions. This could be as simple as sending an alert to the Cortex system, informing the user or manufacturer about the abnormal condition.

Ensuring that the power management system has a failsafe mode addresses the basic safety requirements that prevent overheating and protect against short circuits. When the GFCI detects a ground fault or an excess of heat, the system should trigger a series of automated responses to safely manage the scenario. This feature is fundamental to maintaining operational safety and is likely already integrated based on existing product capabilities. Regular testing and verification of this failsafe system are advised to ensure functionality remains intact over time."
"Subject: RE: Interview for SpaRetailer article about Gecko hot tub water monitor

Salut Véronique,

Voici mes réponses aux questions de la journaliste :

1. Could you give me an overview of what the water monitor is? 

*	Gecko Waterlab monitors temperature, pH (water acidity) and ORP (sanitation level) of a spa vessel and reports back this information through the Gecko App.
	We’ve built in a recommendation engine 

2. Tell me a bit more about its development. What has the process involved? Why create this?

*	Using surveys and interviews, we concluded very rapidly that water maintenance was the #1 pain points for spa owners.
	As such, we started investigating what were the current available solutions on the market and we came 

	1.	Most, if not all, of the water monitoring devices were what we call  ‘’floaters’’, meaning they would float on the water. 
		These products would have a short lifespan since water would inevitably infiltrate within the product.
	2.	A maintenance burden was necessary for every product since water monitoring did necessitate the use of consumable
		Be it a probe or a cassette, the spa owner would need 
		Let’s not forget that all these current devices also run on battery.
	3.	Even when the spa owner manages 

It thus became our mission 

3. Why partner 

*	Water chemistry testing is a whole world on its own and Gecko needed 
	General Galactic, the company which owns Crystal Water, checked all these boxes and were instrumental in guiding us through the development of our product.
	In fact, their innovative and modern approach 

4. Gecko will ultimately be the face of a water monitor in the hot tub industry. What does that mean for the company?

*	Gecko’s state objective is 
	This means thus means going beyond the topside and controls business.
	In fact, we want the spa owner 

5. When do you expect it 

*	The Waterlab will launch during the Dallas trade show on November 12th 2024.

6. How will the product overall impact the hot tub + hot tub owners?

*	The Waterlab is the first fully connected product, and we are eager 
	Continuous improvement and development bring 

7. Anything else you think readers should know?

*	Stay tuned for the release and lets work together on creating the ultimate spa experience.

2.	Identifying the best pH range can change 
	However, here are some important facts:

	*	pH, while an essential for chemical reaction, is mostly balanced 
	*	Acidic water (pH lower than 7) will make sanitizer more efficient, but will also make water more uncomfortable
	*	Human tears have an average pH value of 7.4
	*	The CPO certification (Certified Pool&Spa Operator) gives a range of 7.2 to 7.8 as being adequate range for pH 

We have no issues in providing a custom range for either bullfrog spas or for spas using frog@ease systems.
After all, we monitor pH and ORP and compare these values to ‘’industry standards’’ (which in our case is the CPO certification).
Let me know what you think.

3.	We currently have two probes which detects temperature.
	Our next version of the app, which will be available upon launch, will eliminate the value provided 
	Both sensors are at different positions in the tubing so this may lead 
	Can you confirm that the value provided 

4.	This falls within the first point above, improvement of UI.
	Our product is intended 

	*	A test strip scanner which would provide complimentary information on your water chemistry (Alkalinity, Hardness, CYA) which we call a water report
	*	A chemical scanner which would recognize the chemical you are using and then, do some calculation based on your pH/ORP and the water report and then tell you the exact amount of chemicals 

Let me know if you can play around 
If need be, I can jump into a call and check those

____________________________

Hey Ernesto,

Following a comment which was made during the negociation process 

In fact, this process was mentioned as being a potential source of conflict 

The waterlab has some components (the probe) which do require, at the very least, a FIFO process (so no need for full blown traceability).

The supplier has explicitly stated that the storage liquid may exhibit mold after 1 year of storage (which wouldn’t affect the product performance).

As we speak, does Gecko have the capability of selling probes using the ‘’first in’’ (oldest one) ‘’first out’’ (sold first) process?

I am aware of the limitations and complexities of mass manufacturing, but the process described above is critical for our product.

If we are unable, let me know how I can help and we’ll make this happen,

Thanks for your feedback

Category: Knowledge  
Product: Gecko Waterlab  

For optimal performance of the Gecko Waterlab, it is crucial to implement a First In, First Out (FIFO) process for managing probe components. This ensures that the oldest inventory is used first, thereby reducing the potential for storage-related issues. Specifically, the storage liquid within the probes has been noted by suppliers to potentially exhibit mold growth after a year in storage, although this does not impact the product's performance. By adhering to a FIFO process, Gecko Waterlab can mitigate any concerns regarding the quality and longevity of its components during storage. Establishing a reliable inventory management system to track and sell the earliest acquired probes first will help maintain product integrity even in a mass manufacturing context. Implementing such a process requires careful planning, but adhering to these guidelines ensures optimal operation and customer satisfaction."

Category: Knowledge

Product: Gecko Waterlab

To ensure accurate readings, proper handling of Gecko Waterlab probes is essential. Incorrect handling, such as removing a probe from the spa environment and exposing it to the open air, can lead to erroneous measurement results. For instance, a measurement showing a pH of 11.2, which is unusually high, may suggest that the probe was exposed to conditions outside its intended operational environment. Similarly, unexpected fluctuations in temperature readings could indicate mishandling or environmental deviations.

It is crucial to maintain the probe submerged in the spa water to prevent air interference and ensure stable readings for pH, ORP, and temperature. If unexpectedly high pH results are observed while the ORP is stable and temperature readings are inconsistent, reassessing the handling procedures of the probe may resolve these inconsistencies. Following manufacturer guidelines for usage and storage will promote accurate and reliable data collection for effective spa management."

Category: Knowledge
Product: Gecko Waterlab

The calibration of the pH probe for Gecko Waterlab products requires specific equipment and steps to ensure accuracy and reliability. Essential equipment includes the probe itself, a cap provided within a calibration kit, and two specifically calibrated pH liquids. If the cap is lost, it can be reordered as a spare part, avoiding unnecessary packaging costs. The process starts with initiating the calibration mode via the associated app, designed to be user-friendly and straightforward.

To begin calibration, both pH 7 and pH 4 solutions are used. The user should first execute the in-app calibration by clicking the calibration button and following on-screen instructions. The instructions include details such as scanning the pH 7 bottle, using the solution as instructed, managing probe and valve operations, and following a detailed sequence to ensure proper operation and measurements. The flow involves scanning, pouring, and timing methods for both pH 7 and pH 4 solutions to ensure the probe is accurately calibrated. Finally, once the calibration is successful, it's essential to clean the cap with water to maintain the lifespan of the equipment and prepare for its next use."

Both the in.touch 2 and in.touch 3 systems are designed to integrate seamlessly with various spa components, including the VMS (Variable Massage System). In terms of functionality, these in.touch systems treat the VMS akin to a simple pump. This means that their control logic interprets the commands and feedback from the VMS similarly to how it would manage standard pump operations.

The implication of this treatment is primarily in how the VMS is activated and controlled through the user interface. Users can expect to schedule and operate the VMS with the same ease as they do with simpler pump systems, making for an intuitive and consistent user experience. This simplification can also facilitate easier troubleshooting and maintenance, aligning its function and feedback with the established parameters known for pump systems within the spa setup.

By treating the VMS as a simple pump, the in.touch systems help streamline the integration process, making it straightforward for manufacturers to include these features in their spa products. This compatibility ensures that spa users can enjoy advanced functionality without added complexity in control."

Category: Bug/Troubleshooting
Product: in.ye

In certain Gecko spa systems, a recurring issue with timekeeping in YE3 packs has been identified. Customers have reported that these packs are consistently losing approximately 2 minutes per day. This problem was observed across multiple units, even after replacements of both the YE3 packs and associated topside controls. Despite bench testing new YE5 packs and touchscreens, the issue persists.

The possibility of a manufacturing defect affecting timekeeping across several units raises concerns about the current inventory's reliability. It is imperative that all affected units be inspected for this specific fault. If this issue is confirmed, returning the defective packs for credit and replacing them with functioning units should be prioritized.

Manufacturers and spa technicians should be aware of this issue and advise customers experiencing similar problems to contact support. In the meantime, continue monitoring any new reports of time discrepancies to determine if this problem is widespread and if additional solutions are required."

"Subject: RE: Warning message- Signature 655P 2024 model

Hey Lucas,

We have a quick fix for this, but we have also identified the issue as an ongoing problem.

As such, if this is an ongoing customer issue, I would suggest using the hotfix.

If you have problematic components laying around, we will gladly take them 

The quick fix is as simple as resetting the power on the spa.

We’ve observed that a delay between the pack booting up and the keypad booting up is the cause for this issue.

Basically, the pack will boot up faster than the keypad, tell the system that no keypad has been detected and THEN the keypad will boot up.

This booting mismatch has not been carefully characterised as we have had issues reproducing the issue.

Our current theory would be that there is a link between the grid and this behavior.

As such, we suggest rebooting the spa until both the keypad and pack boot adequately.

Could you also provide additional information on the location of that issue and its prevalence?

Thanks,

A persistent issue has been identified regarding the boot sequence of the Gecko spa system, specifically involving the pack and the keypad components. Users have reported a mismatch in the boot-up speed between the pack and the keypad. The system experiences a delay where the pack boots up faster than the keypad, causing the system to register that no keypad is detected, even though the keypad eventually boots up. Although reproducing this issue consistently has proved challenging, it appears to be linked with power grid behavior.

The immediate solution to resolve this booting mismatch is simply to reset the power in the spa system. By rebooting the system, a user can ensure that both the pack and keypad synchronize their boot-up processes adequately. This temporary fix ensures the system recognizes the keypad properly, allowing users to continue using their spa without further disruptions. However, users encountering this issue frequently are encouraged to report the specific occurrences and their locations to support staff for further investigation and potential long-term solutions."

Hey Jim,

I’ve looked through our documentation.

Here is the information I found:

For the in.ye/yt-v2 RegSlope error is detected when temperature of the regulation probe rise more than 1.3°F during first minutes of heater activation.

Now as for the variability in temperature (between a thermometer in the water and the thermometer within the heater) this can depend on a lot of factors.
One of them is that water temperature is never homogeneous, and the hottest water will always be situated just beside the heater.

Category: Bug/Troubleshooting
Product: in.ye

The RegSlope error in the Gecko in.ye spa heaters is detected when the temperature of the regulation probe rises more than 1.3°F during the initial minutes of heater activation. This indicates a potential malfunction or error in the temperature regulation system. Spa heaters rely on accurate temperature readings to maintain the desired water temperature efficiently. If the regulation probe indicates a temperature rise exceeding this threshold, it might be due to several factors including probe placement or heat distribution inefficiencies within the heater unit.

One common issue related to spa heater temperature discrepancies is the variance between the temperature reading from the heater's internal thermometer and a separate thermometer placed in the water. Water temperature can vary throughout the tub, and the water near the heater tends to be the hottest, affecting internal sensor readings. To address this, ensure that the water in the spa is circulating properly to distribute heat evenly. In addition, regularly calibrate thermometers and check for any obstructions or issues in the heater's probe or associated components for accurate readings. Following this will help in minimizing temperature discrepancies and optimizing the spa’s performance."

However, there is flexibility in using these components across both systems. It has been clarified that the 101435 heater, typically used in YE5 configurations, can also be effectively used in YE3 systems without any functional issues.

The primary reason for this standardization is that certain configurations of the YE5 systems may not support the ground bound openings of the 101535 heater model.

Category: Bug/Troubleshooting  
Product: pumps

In spa systems, UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a crucial communication protocol used to facilitate interaction between the pump and the pack. Sometimes, this communication link may not be properly detected, leading to operational issues. Before considering the return of the unit, there are several steps that users can undertake to resolve this problem. 

Firstly, a power cycle of the system is recommended. This involves turning off the entire spa unit, waiting a few moments, and then restarting it. This simple action can sometimes reset the communication link and resolve detection issues. Secondly, it's important to inspect the physical cable connections between the pack and the pump, ensuring that all connections are secure and properly seated. Loose or corroded connections can impede the UART communication pathway. 

Lastly, users should verify the correct configuration of the VMS (Variable Motor Speed) setting as expected for their system. This ensures that any ongoing communication between components is aligned with the expected parameters. If further issues persist, assistance from a technical support representative may be required to conduct more advanced diagnostic tests and guide the resolution process."

Temperature Monitoring Behavior / Temperature Algorithm

While, as mentioned below, I cannot go in

For the feedback loop, here’s what I can share:

Once the user inputs a new setpoint 

The heater will then activate (depending on the data acquired) and the system up 

Here’s what happens to ‘’recheck’’ if the water temperature is still at the set point.

In.Mix

I’ve checked our internal documentation related 
Here’s what I found:

The issue was formally escalated, and an R&D project was opened internally after the site visit in Wisconsin.

During that visit, our engineers detected high-frequency noise on the temperature probe, which increased when the LED harnesses were connected. 

This reinforced our initial hypothesis that noise was being introduced via the 2-wire DC spa light output, likely due 

While a definitive field solution (like a filter) was not immediately finalized, the engineering team has been exploring potential mitigations. 

At the time, using a custom in.mix 300 unit configured 

Since then, the case was moved 

Next step on my side is 

Let me know if this makes sense for both the water regulation and in.mix

Category: Bug/Troubleshooting
Product: 

During a site visit in Wisconsin, engineers detected an issue involving high-frequency noise affecting the temperature probe of the In.Mix system. This interference increased with the connection of LED harnesses, corroborating suspicions that noise was being introduced through the 2-wire DC spa light output. Although a definitive solution—such as installing a filter—has yet to be finalized, the engineering team is actively investigating potential mitigations. Currently, custom configurations of the in.mix 300 unit are being explored as a temporary measure. Future updates aim to address both water regulation and system design to prevent such noise interference."
